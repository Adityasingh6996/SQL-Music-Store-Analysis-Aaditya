# SQL Music Store Analysis — By Aaditya Singh

This project presents a comprehensive SQL analysis on a realistic music-store database. The aim is to extract meaningful business insights by crafting optimized SQL queries involving complex joins, aggregations, filtering, and multi-table relationships. Through this exercise, I demonstrate hands-on proficiency in SQL for data analytics and business intelligence scenarios.

## 📌 Project Overview

The database schema includes core entities that one would expect in a digital music store environment:

- **Customers** — User profiles and purchase history  
- **Employees / Support Representatives** — Sales support roles  
- **Invoices & Invoice Items** — Recording of transactions and items purchased  
- **Tracks, Albums & Artists** — Content catalog metadata  
- **Genres & Playlists** — Classification and user-curated lists  

Using this structured data, I wrote SQL scripts to answer a series of key analytical questions such as:

- Which genres and artists sell the most tracks?  
- What is the total sales volume and how is it distributed by country?  
- Who are the highest spending customers and what are their purchase habits?  
- Which playlists are the most populated and who contributes the most tracks?  
- How do support representatives perform in terms of customer count and revenue?

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Mastery of **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN** across multiple tables  
- Use of **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **ORDER BY**, and **LIMIT** for analytics queries  
- Application of aggregate functions: **SUM**, **COUNT**, **AVG**  
- Integration of sub-queries and nested queries for advanced insights  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and well-commented SQL code  
- Transforming raw relational data into actionable business intelligence

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is designed to highlight practical SQL skills applicable to real-world data analysis roles: extracting insights, reporting trends, identifying outliers, and making data-driven decisions. It reflects my ability to operate on structured relational datasets and deliver analytics output effectively.
